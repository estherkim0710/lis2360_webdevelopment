    	<h1>A Ruff Rundown About Me</h1>
    	<img src="images/mugshot1.jpeg" width="350" class="fltright"> <!-- fltright class alignes image on right and adds margin -->
    	<p>Hi, my name is Phoebe Banana-Hammock Kim, my mom named me off of a character from the show Friends.  </p>
		<p>I was born on December 20, 2018 in a little town 1.5 hours away from Tallahasse, called Cottondale. My mom picked me up when I was around 10 weeks old. Although it was sad leaving my siblings and parents behind, I knew that the life ahead of me with my new mom was going to be even better. I am not going to lie the first week was a little ruff, I wasn't potty trained, I howled uncontrollably and I knawed on my mom's shoes until she gave them to me as toys, but now I am almost 4 months old and things are getting better each and everyday.	</p>
		<p>My mom tells me I'm special because I am a part of one of the oldest breeds in the world, meaning people don't know where my exact origin is. I'm also apparently apparently a hunting dog, but I don't see myself pursuing that lifestyle seeing that I love everyone, and everything! Im expected to grow to about 13 inches in height and weigh about 25-30 pounds. My mom promises me that she'll make sure I won't become overweight, but I love food way too much. </p>
		<p>I believe my mom picked me because I'm also a bit of a runner, she loves to go running and when I'm older she'll take me on lots of runs around the Doak Stadium and the gorgeous FSU campus! She compliments the white diamond shape that I have on my back a lot so I think that's my beauty mark!</p>
		<p>Even though she gets frustrated with me when I make accidents in the house, or howl at the moon at 1 in the morning, I know she loves me very much and I appreciate her putting in so much time, effort and love into my wellbeing. </p>
