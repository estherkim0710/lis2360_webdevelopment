            <h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
            <p1>
                Many assume that artificial intelligence (AI) is all about talking 
                robots and something that could one day take over the world by out 
                smarting humans, however this is not all what it is all about. 
                Artificial intelligence is actually complex algorithms that can 
                help make decisions using real time data, sensors, and its ability 
                to use different sources to come up with a solution, something that 
                only human intelligence can do. What brings this concept so much 
                attention is that if used and applied correctly, the AI program 
                can adapt and continue to learn from the endless stream of data 
                it is analyzing. With technology growing and advancing every day, 
                AI has also made extreme improvements since its first introduction 
                in the 1950s and gained positive feedback and hope from the population, 
                however it has also raised some red flags and concerns considering 
                its capability to adapt and learn. Like with any new discoveries 
                there are pros and cons to AI as well even if its goal is to be 
                as made and function perfectly.

                Some pros of artificial intelligence is their ability to perform 
                difficult tasks. 
                <i>AI-powered machines are doing jobs humans either can't do or would 
                have to do very carefully. </i>An example of this is space travel, if 
                there was a robot that can be 
                sent to Mars and can explore and collect data that it can send back 
                to stations on Earth, that would mean one less risky jobs for humans 
                to train for and execute. It can also provide error free processing, 
                which is something that a lot of businesses look for so that they 
                can perform other important and creative tasks. Finally, humans 
                can let machines with AI do the boring tasks for them, such as labor. 
                If there was a lawn mower or even on a more industrial scale, a 
                packaging belt, that will know what it is supposed to do and do 
                the job perfectly without constant attention or concern of malfunction, 
                it allows the more people to do other tasks that AI cannot do, yet.

            <p3>
                Although a world where AI can perform all the difficult and 
                dangerous tasks sounds nice, there are also many problems and 
                concerns that brings some hesitation to the idea. AI can be as 
                smart as humans maybe even smarter, however they lack judgement 
                calls and emotion. It still does not have the ability to determine 
                what is right or wrong which can heavily affect a school, a company, 
                or even worse, the economy, maybe even an entire society. Another 
                concern is that there are only a few amount of people who are 
                actually in control of these algorithms, they have the power to 
                either create bias in the program or even cause casualties. Lastly, 
                in a more practical sense and something that is the most likely to happen 
                is the loss of jobs for people. As mentioned before if a machine was 
                created and did a more efficient job on somethingthat would usually 
                take the labor of an entire team, all of those people would 
                potentially lose their jobs. 
            </p3>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p4>
                There is still a lot more work that needs to be done in order to 
                perfect the program's performance while also implementing integrity
                to make sure that the concerns listed above do not happen. It seems 
                that AI is mostly beneficial to difficult tasks and research such 
                as space and deep sea exploration, surgeries and even rescue during
                a disaster. A lot of money and attention is being put into the 
                advancement of AI and the many possibilites these machines and 
                technology can achieve that normally would take a human to be an 
                expert in.
